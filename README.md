# Simple webpage for maubot plugins

See the site itself at:
https://williamkray.github.io/maubot-plugin-list/

this is not meant to be an official site, and is definitely not comprehensive. But i did want to create a simple
location people could go to find maubot plugins easily. the goal is to compile a list of useful plugins that's easy to
search because the readme of the maubot project is getting unweildy and is slow to update.

add new entries by copying and pasting the commented out table content, add a link to your plugin, and a description. it
doesn't need to be long, but make it descriptive enough that it can be used to search. i will try to merge in PRs as
fast as possible!
